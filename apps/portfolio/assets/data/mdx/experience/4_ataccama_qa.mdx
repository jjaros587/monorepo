As a member of the team tasked with developing the 'core' part of the platform, which serves as the foundation for features developed by other teams, my responsibilities included ensuring quality throughout the lifecycle. I focused on test automation, utilizing GraphQL API calls, and also contributed to the development of an internal framework tailored for this purpose.
