I was given an opportunity to switch roles within the company and began developing the app I had previously ensured the quality of. Starting with simple tasks, I quickly progressed to implementing complex features, earning the trust to assume a leadership role. I was driving an initiative involving the breakdown and migration of our codebase to monorepo libraries, leading teams in the development of new features while ensuring successful delivery.
